# Frequently Asked Questions

## Does this App turn Nautobot into a DDI Solution?

No, but you now have DNS as well as IPAM data in one place, so you can write your own automation, like Nautobot Jobs, to deploy/verify configuration on your servers!

## DNS Naming Rules and Internationalization

### Why does my internationalized domain name (or label) fail validation even though it looks short enough?
For internationalized names (those containing non-ASCII characters), the DNS protocol uses a special encoding called IDNA (Internationalized Domain Names in Applications). Some characters use more than one byte in this encoding, so a label or name may reach the 63-byte (per label) or 255-byte (full name) limit before it reaches 63 or 255 characters.

!!! tip
    If you see a length error, try using fewer characters or only ASCII letters and digits. The app checks the encoded (wire format) length, not just the visible character count.

### What DNS standards does this app follow for name validation?
This app enforces DNS naming rules as specified in:

- **[RFC 1035 ยง2.3.4](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc1035#section-2.3.4):**
  Maximum label (63 bytes) and full name (255 bytes) length limits for DNS.

This ensures that all DNS names are valid, interoperable, and compatible with the global DNS system.

!!! note
    DNS validation can be configured or disabled via the `DNS_VALIDATION_LEVEL` setting. See the [installation guide](../admin/install.md#app-configuration) for details.

### What does "wire format" mean in the context of DNS names?
"Wire format" refers to the way DNS names are encoded for transmission over the network. Each label is encoded using the IDNA 2003 standard, and the total length (in bytes) of all labels and dots must not exceed 255 bytes. This is stricter than simply counting characters, especially for internationalized names.
