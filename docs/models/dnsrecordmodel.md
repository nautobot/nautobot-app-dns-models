# DNS Record Model

+++ 1.2.0 "DNS name length rules"
    By default, `DNSRecordModel` now enforces the following DNS label and name length rules, as specified by [RFC 1035 ยง3.1](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc1035#section-3.1):

    - Each label (the parts of the name separated by dots) must be no more than 63 characters long.
    - Empty labels (e.g., consecutive dots or leading/trailing dots) are not allowed.
    - The total length of the fully qualified DNS name (including the zone and all dots, in wire format) must not exceed 255 bytes.
